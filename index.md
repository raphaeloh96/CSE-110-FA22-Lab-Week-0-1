### About me
**Favorite Quote:** *"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them."* ***Albert Einstein*** 

I try my best to live everyday by motto which is: 
>Never try to find an easy way out to achieve happiness in short term, as everything will become much harder in long term.
